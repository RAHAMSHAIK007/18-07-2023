ARTIFACT: its a final product for the code.
JAR = JAVA ARCHIVE	= BACKEND
WAR = WEB ARCHIVE     
EAR = ENTEPRISE ARCHIVE

.java -- > compile -- > .class -- > .jar

.java = raw code
.class = compiled code
.jar = group of .class files

WAR = FRONT END + BACKEND CODE 
FRONTEND = HTML, CSS, JS
BACKEND = JAVA

EAR = ENTERPRISE ARCHIVE
WAR + JAR

HOW TO CREATE ARTIFACTS ?

BUILD TOOL -- > MAVEN 


MAVEN:
its a build tool or project management too1.
it will manage dependency and packages for code.
its is written java by apache software foundation.
it cames on year 2004.
its free and opensource.
it is used for mainly java projects.
home path: .m2 
java: 1.8.0

POM.XML : its a file which contains dependcy and info about project.

POM = PROJECT OBJECT MODEL
XML = EXTENSIBLE MARKUP LANGUAGE

GOAL = its a maven command used to execute a task
PLUGIN = its a small software which automates work.

PRACTICAL:
yum install git java-1.8.0-openjdk maven tree -y
git clone https://github.com/devopsbyraham/jenkins-java-project.git
cd jenkins-java-project.git


MAVEN LIFE CYCLE:
mvn compile	: to compile the code
mvn test	: to test the code
mvn package	: to convert code into artifact
mvn install	: to copy artifcat to .m2
mvn clean	: to delete artifacts

mvn clean package

NOTE: GOAL WILL EXECUTE WHEN THERE IS POM.XML

BUILD TOOL FOR LANGUAGES:

C, C++		= MAKE FILE
.NET		= VISUAL STUDIO
JAVA		= MAVEN, ANT, GRADLE
PYTHON		= GRADLE


MAVEN VS ANT:

maven use pom.xml, ant uses build.xml
maven use plugins, ant uses scripts
plugins are reuseable, scripts are not
maven has lifecycle, ant will not have
maven is declarative, ant is procdeural

PROBLEMS:
war
deployment
structure

POSSIBLE ERRORS:
1. pom.xml
2. code
3. java version

[ERROR] error: Source option 5 is no longer supported. Use 7 or later.
[ERROR] error: Target option 5 is no longer supported. Use 7 or later.
